### TRAILBLAZE

TRAILBLAZE is an in-memory only dropper written in bare C that uses raw syscalls and is designed to be as minimal as possible, likely to ensure it can fit within the shell script as Base64. TRAILBLAZE injects a hook into the identified /home/bin/web process. It will then inject the BRUSHFIRE passive backdoor into a code cave inside that process.

### BRUSHFIRE

BRUSHFIRE is a passive backdoor written in bare C that acts as an SSL_read hook. It first executes the original SSL_read function, and checks to see if the returned data begins with a specific string. If the data begins with the string, it will XOR decrypt then execute shellcode contained in the data. If the received shellcode returns a value, the backdoor will call SSL_write to send the value back.
