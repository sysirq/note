# 主要数据结构

### struct fib_table

A routing table. Do not confuse it with the routing table cache.

### struct fib_alias

Routes that lead to the same destination network but differ with regard to other parameters, such as the TOS, are distinguished by means of fib_alias instances.

### struct fib_info

Some parameters can be shared between different routing table entries. These parameters are stored in fib_info data structures. When the set of parameters used by a new routing entry match those of an already existing entry, the existing fib_info structure is recycled. A reference count keeps track of the number of users. Figure 34-1 in Chapter 34 shows an example.
