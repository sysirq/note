# The PCI Interface

The PCI architecture was designed as a replacement for the ISA standard,with three main goals:to get better performance when transferring data between the computer and its peripherals,to be as platform independent as possible,and to simplify adding and removing peripherals to the system.

# PCI Addressing

Each PCI peripheral is identified by a bus number,a device number,and a function number

The 16-bit hardware addresses associated with PCI peripherals (8 bit bus number,8 bit device(5) and function number(3))
