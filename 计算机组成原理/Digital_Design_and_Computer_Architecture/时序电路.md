The fundamental building block of memory is a bistable(双稳定的) element,an element with two stable states.

# LATCHES AND FLIP_FLOPS

### SR Latch

One of the simplest sequential circuits is the SR latch,which is composed of two cross-coupled NOR gates.The latch has two input,S and R,and two outputs,Q and Q'.(The input S and R stand for set and reset)

When R is asserted,the state is reset to 0.When S isasserted,the state in set to 1.When neither is asserted,the state retains its old value.

### D LATCH

Designing circuits become easier when these questions of what and when are separated.

When CLK = 1,the latch is transparent.The data at D flows through to Q as if the latch were just a buffer.When CLK = 0,the latch is opaque.It blocks the new data from flowing through to Q,and Q retains the old value.

### D Flip-Flop

A D flip-flop can be built from two back-to-back D latches controlled by complementary clocks.

When CLK = 0,the master latch is transparent and the slave is opaque.Therefore,whatever value was at D propagates through to N1.When CLK = 1,the master goes opaque and the slave becomes transparent.The value at N1 propagates through to Q,but N1 is cut off from D.Hence,whatever value was at D immediately before the clock rises from 0 to 1 gets copied to Q immediately after the clock rises.At all other times,Q retains its old value,because there is always an opaque latch blocking the path between D and Q.

In other words,a D flip-flop copies D to Q on the rising edge of the clock,and remembers its state at all other times.

### register

An N-bit register is a blank of N flip-flops that share a common CLK input,so that all bits of the register are updated at the same time.

### Enabled Flip-Flop

An enabled flip-flop add another input called EN or ENABLE to determine whether data is loaded on the clock edge.When EN is TRUE,the enabled flip-flop behaves like an ordinary D flip-flop.When EN is FALSE,the enabled flip-flop ignores the clock and retains its state.

### Resettable Flip-Flop

A resettable flip-flop adds another input called RESET.When RESET is FALSE,the resettable flip-flop behaves like an ordinary D flip-flop.When RESET is TRUE,the resettable flip-flop ignores D and resets the output to 0.

### Putting It All Together

Latches and flip-flops are the fundamental building blocks of sequential circuits.Remember that D latch is level-sensitive,whereas a D flip-flop is edge-triggered.The D latch is transparent when CLK = 1,allowing the input D to flow through to the output Q.The D flip-flop copies D to Q on the rising edge of CLK.At all other times,latches and flip-flop retain their old state.A register is a blank of serveral D flip-flops that share a common CLK signal.

# SYNCHRONOUS LOGIC DESIGN

synchronous sequential circuit composition

- Every circuit element is either a register or a combinational circuit.
- At least one circuit element is a register.
- All registers receive the same clock signal.
- Every cyclic path contains at least one register.

# FINITE STATE MACHINES

An FSM has M inputs,N outputs,and k bits of state.It also receives a clock and,optionally,a reset signal.An FSM consists of two blocks of combinational logic,next state logic and output logic,and a register that stores the state.On each clock edge,the FSM advances to the next state,which was computed based on the current state and inputs.

### State Encodings

One important decision in state encoding is the choise between binary encoding and one-hot encoding.

With binary encoding,each state is represented as a binary number.Because K binary numbers can be represented by log2(K) bits

In one-hot encoding,a separate bit of state is used for each state.It is called one-hot because only one bit is 'hot' or TRUE at any time.

one-hot encoding requires more flip-flops than binary encoding.However,with one-hot encoding,the next-state and output logic is often simpler.

### Moore and Mealy Machines

Mealy machine's output rises a cycle sooner because it responds to the input rather than waiting for the state change.

# TIMING OF SEQUENTIAL LOGIC

Setup time and a hold time,before and after the clock edge.

### The Dynamic Discipline

### System Timing 

All else being the same,increasing the clock frequency increases the work that a digital system can accomplish per unit time.Frequency is measured in units of Hz,or cycle per second.

# Parallelism(平行性)

spatial parallelism(空间并行):multiple copies of the hardware are provided so that multiple tasks can be done at the same time.

temporal parallelism(时间并行): a task is broken into stages,like an assembly line.Multiple tasks can be spread across the stages.Although each task must pass through all stages,a different task will be in each stage at any given time so multiple tasks can overlap.

Pipelining is particularly attractive(迷人) because it speeds up a circuit without duplicating the hardware.Instead,registers are placed between blocks of combinational logic to divide the logic into shorter stages that can run with a faster clock.

Althrough these techniques are powerful,they do not apply to all situations.The bane(痛苦的根源) of parallelism is dependencies.

# Summary

Finit state machines are a powerful technique for designing sequential circuits.To design an FSM,first indentify the inputs and outpus of the machine and sketch a state transition diagram,indicating the states and the transition between them.Select an encoding for the states,and rewrite the diagram as a state transition table and output table,indicating the next state and output given the current state and input.From these tables,design the combinational logic to compute the next state and output,and sketch the circuit.
