### adder

Hardware description languages provide the + operation to specify a CPA(carry propagate adders).

### subtraction

subtraction is almost as easy:flip the sign of the second number.then add.

TO compute Y = A - B ==>  Y = A + B' + 1

This sum can be performed with single CPA by adding A + B' with Cin = 1.

### Comparators

A comparator determines whether two binary numbers are equal or if one is greater or less than the other.

A equality comparator produces a single output indicating whether A is equal to B.

A magnitude(大小) comparator produces one or more outputs indicating the relative values of A and B.usually done by computing A - B and looking at the sign of the result .If the result if negative,then A is less than B.Otherwise A is greater than or equal to B.

### ALU

An arithmetic logical unit combines a variety of mathematical and logical operations into a single unit.For example,a typical ALU might perform addition,subtraction,magnitude comparison,AND,and OR operations.The ALU forms the heart of most computer systems.

SLT(set if less than): when A < B,Y = 1.Otherwise,Y = 0.In other words,Y is set to 1 if A is less than B.

SLT is performed by computing S = A - B,.If S is negative(i.e., the sign bit is set),A is less than B.

### Shifters and Rotators

Shifters and rotators move bits and multiply or divide by powers of 2.

Logical shifter -- shifts the number to left or right and fills empty spots(地方) with 0's.

Arithmetic shifter -- is the same as a logical shifter,but on right shifts fills the most significant bits with a copy of the old most significant bit.

Rotator -- rotates number in circle such that empty spots are filled with bits shifted off the other end.

An N-bit shifter can be built from N N:1 multiplexers

# MEMORY ARRAYS

Registers built from flip-flops are a kind of memory that stores small amounts of data.This section describes memory arrays that can efficiently store large amounts of data.

The memory is organized as a two-dimensional array of memory cells.The memory reads or writes the contents of one of the rows of the array.This row is specified by an Address.The value read or written is called Data.An array with N-bit addresses and M bit data has 2^N rows and M columns.Each row of data is called a word.

### Bit cells

Memory arrays are built as an array of bit cells,each of which stores 1 bit of data.

For each combination of address bits,the memory asserts a single wordline that activates the bit cells in that row.When the wordline is HIGH,the stored bit transfers to or from the bitline.
