A circuit can be viewd as a black box:

- one or more discrete-valued input terminal
- one or more discrete-valued output terminal
- a functional specification describing the relationship between inputs and outputs
- a timing specification describing the delay between input changing and outputs responding.

A circuit is combinational if it consists of interconnected circuit elements such that:

- Every circuit element is itself combinational
- Every node of the circuit is either designated as an input to the circuit or connects to exactly one output terminal of a circuit element
- The circuit contains no cyclic paths:every path through the circuit visits each circuit node at most once

对偶性(duality)：If symbols 0 and 1 and the operators AND(·) and OR(+) are interchanged,the statement will still be correct.

De Morgan's Theorem: complement of the product of all the term is equal to the sum of the complement of each term.

# X

The symbol X indicates that the circuit node has an unknow or illegal value.

contention(争夺): The actual voltage on a node with contention may be somewhere between 0 and Vdd,depending on the relative strengths of the gates driving HIGH and LOW.It is often,but not always,in the forbidden zone.

# Z

The symbol Z indicates that a node is being driven neither HIGH nor LOW.

one common way to produce a floating node is to forget to connect a voltage to a circuit input,or to assume that an unconnected input is the same as an input with the value of 0.

# K-Maps

Rules for finding a minimized equation from a K-map are as follows:

- Use the fewest circles necessary to cover all the 1's
- All the squares in each circle must contain 1's
- Each circle must span a rectangular block that is a power of 2 squares in each direction
- A circle may wrap around the edges of the K-map
- A 1 in a K-map may be circled multiple times if doing so allows fewer circles to be used.

# 基本组合逻辑电路

### 多路转换器（multiplexer）

Multiplexers can be used as lookup tables to perform logic functions.

In general,a 2^N input multiplexer can be programmed to perform any N-input logic function by applying 0's and 1's to the appropriate data input.

### 解码器(Decoders)

A decoder has N inputs and 2^N outputs.It asserts exactly one of its outputs depending on the input combination.

In general,an N:2^N decoder can be constructed from 2^N N-input AND gates that accept the various combinations of true or complementary inputs.Each output in a decoder represents a single minterm.

When using decoders to build logic,it is easiest to express functions as a truth table or in canonical(标准) sum-of-products form.An N-input function with M 1's in the truth table can be built with an N:2^N decoder and M-input OR gate attached to all of the minterms containing 1's in the truth table.


# 时序

combinational logic is characterized by its propagation(传播) delay and contamination(污染) delay.THe propagation delay is the maximum time from when an input changes until the output or outputs reach their final value.The contamination delay is the minumum time from when an input changes until any output starts to change its value.

propagation and contamination delays are also determined by the path a signal takes from input to output.

THe propagation delay of a combinatioanl circuit is the sum of the propagation delays through each element on the critical path.The contamination delay is the sum of the contamination delays through each element on the short path.

# 故障（glitches 毛刺）

As long as we wait for the propagation delay to elapse before we depend on the output,glitches are not a problem.
