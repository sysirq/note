I actually just finished my bachelor degree in electronics and computer engineering. my FYP was designing a soft microprocessor in verilog. tbh that helped me get a job in INTEL :) ... so my advice for you is first go through this book "Deigning Digital Computer Systems With Verilog" pdf link:

Page on pldworld.com

That will give you nice intro specially the first 4 chapters, which will explain some really important points in designing processor:

- it will go through basic verilog

- FSM (Finite State Machine)

- ISA (Instructions set Architecture)

After that I recommend you to go read more about the different design philosophies, which are RISC and CISC.

Read this book "Guide to RISC Processors"

Page on kfupm.edu.sa

btw RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computers

and CISC stands for Complex Instruction Set Computers

you will understand both of them in the first chapter in the above book ;)

If you feel you are not comfortable with verilog go learn it first. do simple projects like designing a digital clock on an FPGA. and some other simple projects. watch this youtube tutorial about verilog:

Verilog Tutorials

Before starting writing code for designing your processor draw your data path and try to think about the instructions that your processor will be able to execute e.g. add, sub, mult, load, store, etc. after that think how the each instruction will be executed it inside the data path( micro architecture ).

Have a look at my poster for my FYP it might help a bit:

Finally when you decide that you wanna start properly designing your processor with verilog look up this AMAZING BOOK ;) "ADVANCED DIGITAL DESIGN WITH VERILOG HDL" by Michael D. Ciletti

This book will be your BEST friend when you start coding :)

Remember always when you get stuck with something don't give up and go read more about it online and then go back to it and try to resolve it.

One last advice is that when you start designing your first block in verilog Do TEST it before you start writing a code for other blocks because if you design all your blocks and then you connect them together and you start testing the whole design and you find out that your design doesn't behave the way you want then you will be in a big trouble. so always test each block individually.

Thats all i can remember right now. I'm really sorry if i forgot something important but anyway if you have any questions I'm happy to help.
